    "New York City (NYC), Toronto, Tokyo -- three major international megacities. <br/>\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "The first two are large-multicultural cities where English — the language of business — is widely spoken. One the other hand, Japanese the the business language in Tokyo with growing number of people communicating in English. Cities like NYC and Toronto Cities are mostly known for their boroughs and the cultures of individual neighborhoods, whereas Tokyo is renown for being an in-gathering of Japanese citizens from all over the country. Nevertheless, all three of them has huge potential for anyone move in if they have the education and the work ethic necessary to be successful. <br/>\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "New York is famous for the boroughs of Manhattan, Queens, Brooklyn, Staten Island, and the nearby cities of Long Island. It is very big, sometime when people refers to NYC they just mean Manhattan. Within these boroughs, NYC can be divided into neighborhoods like Chinatown and Wallstreet, which are very distinct in terms of life style and culture. With almost 200 languages spoken, 40 percent of the NYC population was born outside of the United States. NYC is truely a ever-changing rainbow of worlds. <br/>\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "Toronto, another example of multiculture metropolitan, has over 250 ethnicities and 170 languages. Unlike NYC though, the neighborhoods are less segregated by culture. They still have neighborhoods like chinatown and kinston market, but the neighborhoods are more represented by life styles, at least I think so. <br/>\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "Tokyo is divided up into various districts called ‘wards’. It is more known for its cultural landmarks than its diversity. This is because the city population is still around 90% Japanese, and many businesspeople and tourists who have lived there are only temporary residents. It is highly likely that people will be shockedby the stoic silence on the trains, and the differences in cultural etiquette when first come to Tokyo. However, with growing business and uniquenss of it, Tokyo now attract more and more global citizens. \n",

    "- How are their neighborhoods clustered. How similar/disimilar are they in terms of neighborhood categories? Is toronto much more similar in in terms of their neighoods venues with NYC compared to Tokyo?\n",
    "Another interesting question we can answer is that:\n",
    "- Since they all have a lot of potential, if we want to open a new business in one of them, which type of venue is more likely to succed. Or if we have a given venue to start, which neighborhood of them is more likely to accept it?"
