### Introduction
New York City (NYC) and Tokyo — two major international megacities. They are both densely populated! NYC has more than 8 million residents with population density around 30000 per mile. Tokyo has 13 million residents, and the population density is about half of NYC. In terms of living quality, both cities have convenient public transportations, adequate schools and good health care system. Moreover, they are both accessible to seaside beaches, with similar temperature and humidity rate all year around! What are the differences?<br/>
NYC is a multi-cultural city, known for its boroughs and the cultures of individual neighborhoods. Though English the official language for business, more than 40 percent of the NYC population was born outside of the United States who speaks more than 200 languages. NYC’s boroughs include Manhattan, Queens, Brooklyn, Staten Island, and the nearby cities of Long Island. It is so spread-out that often when people refer to ‘city’ they just mean Manhattan. Within these boroughs, NYC can be divided into neighborhoods like Chinatown and Financial District, which are very distinct in nature.
Tokyo, on the other hand, is divided up into various districts called wards. Even with growing number of people communicating in English, Japanese is still essential for living in Tokyo. It is more famous for its cultural landmarks than its diversity. This is because the city population is around 90% Japanese, and many businesspeople and tourists who have lived there are only temporary residents. It is highly likely that people will be shocked by the stoic silence on the trains, the inevitable language barrier, and the differences in cultural etiquette when first come to Tokyo. However, with growing business and uniqueness of it, Tokyo now attract more and more global citizens.<br/>
Since Tokyo and Manhattan have some similarities and some striking differences, one interesting thing to compare is that:<br/>
How similar are they in terms of business owners? If we are have a venue profiting in Manhattan, which wards are we more likely to be successful in Tokyo. <br/>
We will answer this by exploring a specific question — finding an optimal location for a family-style Chinese restaurant we want to launch in both cities.
